= Scraping with Geb

http://www.gebish.org[Geb] is a browser automation solution.
It brings together the power of http://code.google.com/p/selenium/[WebDriver],
the elegance of http://jquery.com/[jQuery] content selection,
the robustness of http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects[Page Object] modeling and the expressiveness
of the http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] language.

Geb is often used as a functional/web/acceptance testing solution via integration with testing frameworks such as
Spock, JUnit & TestNG. In this article, we are going to show how Geb can be used to Screen Scraping.

The next steps describe how to **create a Webbot which scrapes the OCI Training Website**.

== Project configuration

https://guides.gradle.org/building-groovy-libraries/[Create a Groovy Library] with Gradle.

[source, bash]
----
$ mkdir scraper
$ cd scraper
$ gradle init --type groovy-library
----

Replace the content of `build.gradle` with:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::../../../build.gradle[tag=applygroovyplugin]

include::../../../build.gradle[tag=repositories]

include::../../../build.gradle[tag=versiongroup]

include::../../../build.gradle[tag=dependencies]

include::../../../build.gradle[tag=test]
----

Geb builds on the WebDriver browser automation library, which means that Geb can work with any browser that WebDriver can.
The previous `build.gradle` includes dependencies for Geb, Selenium and the two browsers (htmlUnit and firefox) used in this webbot.


Geb attempts to load a ConfigSlurper script named `GebConfig.groovy` from the default package (in other words, in the root of a directory that is on the classpath)

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/GebConfig.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/GebConfig.groovy[]
----

The Groovy ConfigSlurper mechanism has built-in support for
environment sensitive configuration, and Geb leverages this by using
the `geb.env` system property to determine the environment to use.
An effective use of this mechanism is to configure different drivers
based on the designated Geb “environment”

To use Firefox driver, supply the System property `geb.env` with value `firefox`.
To use HTMLUnit (a GUI-LESS browser) driver, supply the System property `geb.env` with value `htmlUnit.`

== Understanding the page

If you visit `https://objectcomputing.com/training/schedule/` and inspect
 the Track selector you can check the different Track Ids.

image::select-tracks.png[link=images/select-tracks.png]

If you visit `https://objectcomputing.com/training/schedule/?track=11`,the training offerings are filtered by _Grails Training_.
The `track parameter takes the track ID as a value.

image::filtered-track.png[link=${imagedir}filtered-tracks.png]

Clicking a training offering opens a modal window. That modal window includes important information. For example, if the
course is _Sold Out_.

image::popup.png[link=images/popup.png]

Clicking a training offering is equivalent to visiting `https://objectcomputing.com/training/schedule/#schedule-offering-48`.
The last number of the previous url is the offering id.

== Map Information to a Model

Create the next classes to model OCI's training offering.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/model/Offering.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/model/Offering.groovy[]
----

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/model/Track.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/model/Track.groovy[]
----

== Encapsulate different areas with Pages

The Page Object Pattern gives us a common sense way to model content in a reusable and maintainable way.
From the http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects[WebDriver wiki page on the Page Object Pattern]:
____
    Within your web app’s UI there are areas that your tests interact with.
    A Page Object simply models these as objects within the test code.
    This reduces the amount of duplicated code and means that if the UI changes,
    the fix need only be applied in one place.
____

Create a Geb Page is a simple as creating a class which extends `geb.Page`.

Geb features a DSL for defining page content in a templated fashion, which allows
very concise yet flexible page definitions. Pages define a static closure property
called `content` that describes the page content.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrackSelectorPage.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrackSelectorPage.groovy[]
----

The next page traverses the training offerings table.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrainingSchedulePage.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrainingSchedulePage.groovy[]
----

The next page checks if the text "Sold Out" appears in the modal window content.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrainingScheduleModalPage.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrainingScheduleModalPage.groovy[]
----

The previous two pages override the method `convertToPath` which allows building dynamic urls.

You could have created a single page which encapsulated all the functionality described in the previous
three pages. But having smaller pages makes the code easier to follow and mantain.

== Orchestrate navigation

The next class organizes the navigation while capturing the training information.

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrainingScheduleBrowser.groovy
----
include::../../main/groovy/com/objectcomputing/geb/TrainingScheduleBrowser.groovy[]
----

If you execute, `Set<Offering> offerings = TrainingScheduleBrowser.offerings()` and supply the `-Dgeb.env=firefox`.

You will see a browser popup and navigate the OCI Training offerings as displayed in the next video.

== Next Steps

The next logical step would be to output the scraped information. We have developed a
https://github.com/sdelamo/grails-plugin-oci-training[Grails Plugin]
which encapsulates this library. It executes the scraper each hour to get the latest training information.
The scraped information is cached and exposed as a JSON API.

Each http://guides.grails[Grails Guide] displays training information up-to-date thanks to this scraper which
has transformed a static HTML page in a JSON API.

Happy scrapping with http://gebish.org[Geb]!
